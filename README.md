Social Media and Network Analysis - Analysis of Huawei Network Data
----------------

Huawei is mainly doing its business in the telecommunication area. Though it is a successful company, it is very difficult for to target new customers and more importantly retain the customers who are already using this brand. In a market that is saturated with smartphones its difficult for a new company to seize its customers. 

This project has two main goals:
• We try to understand how this company is being perceived by its customers and employees and what kind of information we can derive from analyzing the network formed by it.  
• Understanding the layout and connections between the nodes, would help us generate insights into the company’s marketing strategy and come up with suggestions, if any. 


• Even though the number of nodes across all platforms are same, the connections/edges between the nodes make a network dense or sparse. Considering the number of edges, Twitter is very dense network, the Facebook has next highest edges. This gives us an idea of how Huawei is being talked about or exposed to in different platforms. A company can have huge follower base in a platform, but if no one are actually exchanging any information about it, it would mean that it is not having a good exposure to the public.  

• Next metric is clustering coefficient, which is high in Twitter network. This means that the nodes that form clusters in Twitter are very high. It could signify that Twitter is tightly knit community. The clustering coefficient of Instagram is very less signifying the sparsity and low connectedness of the network.  

• Diameter is the shortest distance between any two nodes that are very far. When we see the diameter of Twitter, it is less compared to other two platforms. This reinforces that the Twitter is tightly knitted community so the distance between the far nodes is just 2. This also signifies how fast information can spread in twitter compared to others. On the other hand, the shortest distance between far nodes in Instagram is highest reiterating the fact that it is very sparsely connected. 

• Another interesting observation we made when looking at the statistics is, the nodes which are highly connected are not the same across 3 platforms. Also, the nodes least connected are not the same either. This shows that different nodes have different preference of media platform that they interact the most in.

Connecting all observations and exercises we carried out so far, we want to conclude that, even though we intuitively think the way the network is connected and the way the nodes interact with each other is evident, it is not always the case. Like we saw from the subgraphs, the most connected nodes are not always in the thick of things, and from information spread we see that, even though lesser connected nodes are in the fringes, it does not mean they are not important to the spread of information. They are as important to a network as the most connected nodes as they are key in recycling the information after it has passed a certain time.
